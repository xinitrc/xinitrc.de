      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Martin Hilscher. I currently work a as a developer and system architect at <a href="http://jungehaie.com">jungen haie</a>. Previous to that I was a research assistant and PhD Candidate at the <a href="http://www.uni-oldenburg.de">Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg</a> in Germany, where I previously studied computer science and philosophy.</p>

        <h2>I am a software architect</h2>
        <p>At my job at the junge haie I am working as a developer and system architect which is to say, not only developing but thinking about the larger structures and techniques with which we build software there. Since we try to be on the top of our game at junge haie this usually means, going to stack overflow is pointless, as most of the problems haven't been solved or not solved to the degree we like it. Which makes my work there very much resemble my previous work at the university.</p>

      <section class="level2" id="a-computer-scientist">
        <h2>I am a computer scientist</h2>
        <p>And if you beliefe most students one of the worst kind, a theoretical computer scientist. Which is to say I’m somewhat on the verge between a computer scientist and a mathematician. My PhD topic is on building a logic and tools for proofing safety of car manoeuvres.</p>

      <section class="level2" id="a-hacker">
        <h2>I am a hacker</h2>
        <p>By several accounts I’m what's called a Hacker. Not the sinister kind you might think of now and not the ones wearing those ridiculous masks. But someone interested in using (mostly) technology in an unintended way. Think of me as someone who gets a box of Legos and doesn’t assemble them according to the manual (who would ever do that?)</p>
        <p>What remains to say is, that I tend to not only use this approach with technology. I usually try to disassemble, mix and reassemble my whole world.</p>
        <p>Current hacking interests contain:</p>
        <ul>
	  <li><a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a></li>
	  <li><a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a></li>
	  <li><a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a></li>
	  <li>UI/UX Design</li>
	</ul>

      <section class="level2" id="an-asperger-autist">
        <h2>I am an asperger autist</h2>
        <p>I’m a diagnosed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome">asperger autist</a>, you can read at length about that in the Wikipedia and other places on this internet.</p>    
        <p>I’m pretty open about this, even though this has lead to people treating me like damaged goods and tip-toeing around me. Trust me I’m not and you don’t need to. If you can stand me being somewhat direct, leave me alone when I seem to need my space, and are ok with seeing any attempt of smalltalk with me coming to a absolute standstill within two sentences everything will work out fine.</p>
        <p><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> To asses if I can currently engage in smalltalk or any non-factual conversation, ask me what my thoughts on your shoes/… are. If my answer is something like „They are brown“ your attempts are futile.</p>
