I held a talk on the techincal infrastructure our club provides. Especially:

* Jira
* Confluence
* The clubs homepage and it's features

The talk is once again in german, the video is flickering and there seems to be an audio problem (which we probably will get fixed). I hope some of you can still enjoy it.
