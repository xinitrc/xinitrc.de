Recently I put up serveral sites and blogs, most of them in
[Drupal](http://www.drupal.org) and I actually maintain serveral of
those still. The main is probably the site of our
[hackspace](http://ktt-ol.de) (german). But I thought for my own blog, it might
be fun to test something new. The decision for
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) was due to a collegue asking me for a
modern static site generator for his personal homepage. We both had
some exprience with static site generators as until a recent decision
by our university to maintain all sites with a Typo3 (insert the sound
of my head hitting some hard object) we generated the site of our
group with [htp](http://htp.sourceforge.net/). As you can see from the
sourcforge page it is by now rather old, so it was no real option
anymore. But when he asked somewhere from the back of my head Jekyll
crawled it's way up.

After I told him that Jekyll exists he went on building his site
within 24 hours and showed me the next day. As there where several
oddities regarding current HTML and CSS standards (slightly rephrasing
him "I don't really know about modern webdesign, I would have put
&amp;nbps; in to align that.") So I first
set out to build a very similar site more or less to show him some of
the tricks he could use. But when I was ready with my version, I
thought "Hey looks pretty good let's take this for my blog." And so
I did, the result you can see here. Obviously I'm not done yet with the
functionality, I'll probably never be, I'm a computer scientist and
hacker after all. 

## The setup

Without further ado here is how this site is set up. As you can
already see at the bottom of the page it's build with Jekyll and
[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). Comments are
provided by [Disqus](http://disqus.com), after you registered an
account with them they you actually just have to follow this
[howto](http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472138-jekyll-installation-instructions)
to get your own comments, so I won't repeat that here. 

Furthermore I added a tagging plugin, I actually modified 
[jekyll-tagging](https://github.com/pattex/jekyll-tagging) and merged
it with
[a logarithmic tag cloud](https://gist.github.com/2290195). A second
plugin allows for excerpt which are generated by just putting
"&lt;!--more--&gt;" any place in the post and by that have everything
before that as an excerpt. The third and currently last plugin is
actually the first Jekyll plugin I wrote myself and allows me to put
mathmatical formulae in my blogposts and have them converted into
MathML. I'll probably detail that in upcoming blog posts. 

## Remote site building

Obviously I could just build my page locally and then upload it to
my webspace. But would that be hacker-like? Don't think about an answer
it was an rethorical question. Obviously NO!  
My extremly awsome hosting provider [uberspace](http://uberspace.de)
allows me to do almost anything programatically. So I put up a remote
git repository and added a
[post-receive hook](http://kahlil.co/2011/07/24/uberkyll/), which
checks out the repository as soon as I push, builds it with Jekyll and
copys it over to my htdocs directory. Since the linked tutorial
is german I'll try to translate that to english later on. 

## Conclusion

So this is it my new blog let's see how far it goes.
