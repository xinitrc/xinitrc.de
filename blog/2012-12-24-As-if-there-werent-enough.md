... podcasts already. Anyway we started a new one and by we I mean
[\@madmalik](http://twitter.com/madmalik),
[\@felis_blue](http://twitter.com/felis_blue) and myself. It's going to
be about "interesting" science stuff and since felis and I have a
rather mathematical background much of it will be centred around
math.

The only bad thing might be, it's in German which is only part of the
possible audience of this blog, ... or it is a good reason to learn
German already. It's really not that hard, 5 year olds can speak it
... just forget that.

And now final details: It's called "Death of a travelling salesman" and
you can find it here [http://dots-podcast.de](http://dots-podcast.de).

I hope you have as much fun listening to it as we have making it.
